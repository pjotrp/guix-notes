* Introduction

GNU Guix is designed to be installed in /gnu/store/ + hash. The
'hard-coded' path has a reason - it means we can store paths inside
binaries and create reproducible build. If apache depends on an ssl
library, the link is fully referenced in the apache binary. There is
no way to circumvent the pointer to the library. Also the hard paths
mean they can be shared between systems, which makes trusted binary
deployment possible.

For those on systems that have no root access, i.e., who can not
create /gnu/store this is a real bummer. If your administrators are
enlightened they may create /gnu/store for you and allow you to copy
files across built on a system where you have root access. This is a
solution on several HPC systems out there already and does not require
a running Guix daemon.

But still, there are those who won't even allow you to do that. For
those environments the only solution is to build Guix on a relative
path. It can be done, but it has downsides: these binary deployments
are not the same as the main distribution and may behave
differently. The Guix community will find it hard to help you with
your specific setup.

One intermediate solution is to rewrite binary paths, as I (pjotr) did
successfully with [[https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-relocatable-binary-packages/tree/master/packages][ldc]]. It has the advantage of using actual Guix built
(reproducible) binaries but requires some hacking. Maybe I'll get
around to writing something generic one day.

Proot is a user land tool that runs on most Linux kernels. It
intercepts path names and convert them on the fly. So you can tell it
to convert everything in $HOME/opt to / (root directory). I.e., create
a virtual root. The downside of using proot is that it comes at a
performance price.

This document aims to find a reproducible way to bootstrap Guix in
proot and get a recent Guix daemon running. The goal is to install
software in a special directory that runs *without* proot. That way we
can deploy Guix packages without ever having administrator
privileges. Something that is wished for in HPC environments.

The main tricks are:

1. Install proot (there are many ways and it should not be hard)
2. Download and run the Guix binary tarball inside proot
3. Run the guix-daemon in proot without root privileges
4. Set the ACL to be able to download pre-built binaries
5. Install the hello package (test)
6. Install the build packages required for building guix
7. Build the source tree inside proot
8. Start the updated guix-daemon and tell it to use a different store relative to $HOME
9. Start building packages relative to $HOME
10. Run software packages without proot(!)

All without root access to your HPC. Note that much of this can be
avoided if you actually have a build host (somewhere) with root
privileges - even a laptop - as 'guix pack' allows you to copy files
across to a different host. As long as the store path is the same.

* Install proot

Proot can rewrite paths transparently so your home directory looks
like a root directory (where we create /gnu/store).  The first thing
to do is install proot on your build system. This can be done with
compilation from [[https://proot-me.github.io/][source]]. If you happen to have Guix running somewhere
you can move proot across:

: scp $(guix build proot-static)/bin/proot remote:

where remote is the non-root machine name.

Create a directory to install Guix, e.g.

: mkdir ~/guix-no-root

* Install the Guix binary installation

Fetch the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/download/][binary tarball]] and install in your directory, e.g.,

: cd ~/guix-no-root
: wget https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-binary-0.13.0.x86_64-linux.tar.xz
: tar --warning=no-timestamp -xf  guix-binary-0.13.0.x86_64-linux.tar.xz

now you can remove the tar ball

: rm guix-binary-0.13.0.x86_64-linux.tar.xz

* Run proot

At this point you should be able to locate bash in the store and, for example,
do

: proot -r . gnu/store/02426nwiy32cscm4h83729vn5ws1gs2i-bash-static-4.4.12/bin/bash

the '-r .' fakes the new root '/' directory.  type 'exit' to leave
again.

Note the 02426nwiy32cscm4h83729vn5ws1gs2i hash path for bin/bash may
differ on your system - this will happen over time with Guix
distributions getting updated. Same for all hashes listed below. Just look
inside your store with a command like

: ls gnu/store/*/bin/bash

to fish out the paths.

* Run guix daemon in proot

Open a new terminal window and start the guix daemon

: proot -r '.' -b /proc -b /dev -b /etc gnu/store/vir3lrwqy50pr8fkaf3m091dgbrja2n6-guix-0.13.0/bin/guix-daemon

and run guix in the another terminal

: proot -r '.' -b /proc/ gnu/store/vir3lrwqy50pr8fkaf3m091dgbrja2n6-guix-0.13.0/bin/guix package -A hello

should list packages and an install command

: proot -r '.' -b /proc/ gnu/store/vir3lrwqy50pr8fkaf3m091dgbrja2n6-guix-0.13.0/bin/guix package -i hello

should show something like this in the daemon terminal:

: accepted connection from pid 25742, user 502

So, far so good, but the build fails with

: guix package: error: symlink: No such file or directory: "/home/user/.guix-profile"

this is because in the new proot there is no such directory. So, create it.
The build system also need /tmp

: mkdir -p /home/user /tmp

The build daemon will still complain:

:  ERROR: In procedure open-file: Permission denied: "/etc/guix/acl"

but that does not prevent guix from downloading source packages. We would like
binary downloads, to import an existing acl file with something like

: mkdir etc_guix
: cp gnu/store/vir3lrwqy50pr8fkaf3m091dgbrja2n6-guix-0.13.0/share/guix/hydra.gnu.org.pub etc_guix/acl

and modify it to look like:

: (acl
:  (entry
:   (public-key
:    (rsa
:     (n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
:     (e #010001#)
:     )
:   )
:  (tag
:   (guix import)
:   )
:  )

restart the daemon with

#+begin_src sh   :lang bash
proot -0 -b /proc -b /dev -b /etc -r . -b etc_guix/acl:/etc/guix/acl gnu/store/vir3lrwqy50pr8fkaf3m091dgbrja2n6-guix-0.13.0/bin/guix-daemon --disable-chroot
#+end_src sh   :lang bash

(note the extra -0 and chroot switches) and you should see on a guix
package install

: substitute: updating list of substitutes from 'https://mirror.hydra.gnu.org'... 100.0%

which makes for faster installs! Btw ignore the --build-users-group
warning switch here it has no real use in proot.

Now we have the guix-daemon running we can install a package

* Install and run the hello package

: proot -b /proc/ -r . gnu/store/vir3lrwqy50pr8fkaf3m091dgbrja2n6-guix-0.13.0/bin/guix package -i hello

After installing the hello package we can run it with proot. First
locate the file:

: find gnu/store/ -name hello
: gnu/store/prvjrj6i8cz7rvkgm643h952bv2daj1h-hello-2.10/bin/hello

and run it

: proot gnu/store/prvjrj6i8cz7rvkgm643h952bv2daj1h-hello-2.10/bin/hello
: Hello, world!

this has also been added to our profile in home/user/.guix-profile,
so we can run it as

: proot home/user/.guix-profile/bin/hello

isn't that the coolest thing!

* Compile Guix from source

So far, we bootstrapped Guix from its binary installation
without root privileges. Next step is to create a reproducible build
system using proot which will allow us to build packages that can be
run *without* proot. That is necessary because proot introduces system
overheads - especially when reading files. We care about that when we
want to run software in HPC environments.

The following is pretty similar to what is desribed in [[INSTALL.org]] in
'Building GNU Guix from source (using Guix)'. With proot we install
all build tools in our working directory:

: proot -r '.' -b /proc/ gnu/store/vir3lrwqy50pr8fkaf3m091dgbrja2n6-guix-0.13.0/bin/guix package -i guix help2man git strace pkg-config less vim binutils coreutils grep gawk ld-wrapper --no-grafts

make a note of the provided shell paths. In my case

:   export GIT_EXEC_PATH="/home/user/.guix-profile/libexec/git-core"
:   export GUILE_LOAD_PATH="/home/user/.guix-profile/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH"
:   export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH="/home/user/.guix-profile/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache:/home/user/.guix-profile/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH"

we create a full blown guix environment for building with

: proot -b /proc/ -r . gnu/store/vir3lrwqy50pr8fkaf3m091dgbrja2n6-guix-0.13.0/bin/guix environment guix --ad-hoc help2man git strace pkg-config less vim binutils coreutils grep --no-grafts --bash

it will end with a

: guix environment: error: execlp: No such file or directory

(it would be nice we got a shell, but no matter) after installing all
packages we take a clean bash

: env -i proot -b /proc -b /dev -r '.' gnu/store/k7029k5va68lkapbzcycdzj7m5bjb4b8-bash-4.4.12/bin/bash --login --noprofile --norc
: bash-4.4$

paste above shell paths or pick up the profile environment

: . home/user/.guix-profile/etc/profile

if needed, set the path to the profile

: export PATH=/home/user/.guix-profile/bin

and you should be able to do

: git --version
: guile --version
: guix --version
: gcc --version

if files are missing, simply install them with guix (we no longer
depend on the underlying Linux distribution). For some reason running
guix inside proot got me warn-about-old-distro, so I had to do that
outside the proot shell. The full thing is

#+begin_src sh   :lang bash
proot -r '.' -b /proc/ gnu/store/vir3lrwqy50pr8fkaf3m091dgbrja2n6-guix-0.13.0/bin/guix package -i \
  autoconf automake bzip2 gcc-toolchain gettext \
  guile libgcrypt pkg-config sqlite m4 make \
  gnutls guile-json gawk ld-wrapper
#+end_src sh   :lang bash

when that works we clone the guix source tree (outside proot) to get
the latest and greatest

: git clone http://git.sv.gnu.org/r/guix.git

and run the proot bash again, setting the profile and

: proot -b /proc -b /dev -b /etc -b /bin -b /lib -b /lib64 -r . gnu/store/vir3lrwqy50pr8fkaf3m091dgbrja2n6-guix-0.13.0/bin/guix environment guix --ad-hoc help2man git strace pkg-config less vim binutils coreutils grep gawk --no-grafts -- bash

once bootstrapped it actually may be enough to run

: env -i proot -b /proc -b /dev -b /etc -b /bin -b /lib -b /lib64 -r '.' gnu/store/k7029k5va68lkapbzcycdzj7m5bjb4b8-bash-4.4.12/bin/bash --noprofile --norc --login

: . /home/user/.guix-profile/etc/profile

: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin:/bin
: cd guix
: ./bootstrap
: ./configure --localstatedir=/var
: time make -j 8 # for 8 cores though guile manages itself
:   real    11m26.352s
:   user    37m52.192s
:   sys     0m50.012s

and you should have a fresh Guix (the build is slow though, much
slower than without proot).

Now you should be able to run a very recent guix

: ./pre-inst-env guix --version

to update

: ./pre-inst-env guix package -i guix

got a conflict, so I create a new profile

: mkdir ~/opt
: ./pre-inst-env guix package -p ~/opt/guix-latest -i guix --no-grafts

Now we should have the latest guix-daemon set up! In the second
terminal again rerun it with

: proot -0 -b /proc -b /dev -b /etc -r . -b etc_guix/acl:/etc/guix/acl home/user/opt/guix-latest//bin/guix-daemon --disable-chroot

* Building packages to run without proot

But wait! Now we can start building new stuff ready for non-root! All
we need to do is tell the daemon what store to target. To do that
rebuild GNU Guix from source, but this time tell configure
--with-store-dir=PATH and --localstatedir=DIR. The first defaults to
/gnu/store and the second to /var/guix. So, if we target $HOME/opt we can
do

: rm -rf autom4te.cache/ # to be sure
: echo "Installing to $HOME/opt"
: ./configure --localstatedir=$HOME/opt/var --with-store-dir=$HOME/opt/store --prefix=$HOME/opt/local
: make clean-go
: make clean
: time make -j 8

Note that there exist limitations on the size of the store path for
shell scripts - so, don't go very deep. Note also that $HOME should
point to a path that is valid both on your system and in proot (check it!)

We also need to build the daemon and install guix in

: make guix-daemon
: make install

Note that guix has been installed in $PREFIX/bin this time (also
inside proot). Now we need to run the new guix and daemon.

In both terminals running Guix daemon and client you need to set both

: NIX_STORE_DIR=$HOME/opt/store
: NIX_STATE_DIR=$HOME/opt/var

as Roel [[https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/guix-additions/blob/master/doc/Deployment.md][documented]].  Restart the new daemon with settings:

: env NIX_STORE_DIR=$HOME/opt/store NIX_STATE_DIR=$HOME/opt/var proot  -b /proc -b /dev -b /et-b /lib -r . -b etc_guix/acl:/etc/guix/acl guix/guix-daemon --disable-chroot

and inside the proot shell you can do

: env NIX_STORE_DIR=/home/wrk/opt/store NIX_STATE_DIR=/home/wrk/opt/var  ./pre-inst-env guix package -i hello

or run it directly with proot:

: env NIX_STORE_DIR=$HOME/opt/store NIX_STATE_DIR=$HOME/opt/var proot -r '.' -b /proc opt/local/bin/guix package -i hello --no-grafts --no-substitutes

and install at leisure. Note that, at this point, the download script
needs a fix. The first hash bang needs to point to a bash in the
store (see below).

Note also you can build in parallel and continue with
guix package switches -c 8 -M 8 -k. Use them and use your cores!

: env NIX_STORE_DIR=$HOME/opt/store NIX_STATE_DIR=$HOME/opt/var proot -r '.' -b /proc opt/local/bin/guix package -i hello --no-grafts --no-substitutes -c 8 -M 8 -k

With those packages build in $HOME/opt/store we no longer require
proot to run them. For example I built gcc

: ldd store/75d52cyi8qd3cphz5am1hwp5anjihmpp-gcc-5.4.0/bin/gcc
:         linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffce6b1c000)
:         libm.so.6 => /home/wrk/opt/store/k3q0r9lp2gfbkw04iy4n25vxsrfchz1f-glibc-2.25/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007fe097e34000)
:         libc.so.6 => /home/wrk/opt/store/k3q0r9lp2gfbkw04iy4n25vxsrfchz1f-glibc-2.25/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007fe097a95000)
:         /home/wrk/opt/store/k3q0r9lp2gfbkw04iy4n25vxsrfchz1f-glibc-2.25/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fe098146000)

and it runs without proot inside my $HOME (you need to symlink the
store to a working path)

: ln -s ~/guix-no-root/gnu/store ~/opt/store

: ./store/75d52cyi8qd3cphz5am1hwp5anjihmpp-gcc-5.4.0/bin/gcc --version
: gcc (GCC) 5.4.0
: Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

I'll show a more recent version when I get there.

* Disabling tests

GNU Guix builds with tests switched on by default. When building a
system from source this can be very annoying - some packages have
extremely long runnnnnnnning tests. You can patch Guix to skip testing
(note this is heresy and you'll never find it endorsed or an option
added, but if someone has to come clean it might as well be me!). The
following disables testing in a number of build systems, you'll get
the idea.

* Warning

WARNING: it is really easy to mix up running daemons on one
machine. Always make sure the right daemon is running before you
want to install software and use the matching guix client with or without
NIX_STORE_DIR and NIX_STATE_DIR! A warning from experience.

* Trouble shooting

** error: cannot bind to socket

turned out to be a proot switch -r

** warn-about-old-distro

Guix versions won't run if they are old. Use a more recent version
of the daemon.

** refusing to run with elevated privileges (UID 0)

Use proot -0 switch on the daemon.

** guix-daemon crashes X

When setting the --build-group of the guix-daemon in proot X would crash
on my machine. You can avoid the switch, as mentioned above.

** guix package: error: unsupported manifest format

You have probably run a newer guix-daemon and the format has changed
and now you are trying to run an older one. A 'guix pull' saved me
once because it built a new daemon after

: guix pull
: guix package -i guix -p ~/opt/guix

** error: failed to run download program '/home/user/opt/local/libexec/guix/download': No such file or directory

This is caused by the hash bang #!/bin/bash not being picked up in the
script. Modify it to point to a bash in a visible store (no bash
without hash), e.g. replace it with

#!/store/gnsc9ssv2zbmlw6l51fvgjy8s9lzha64-bash-4.4.12/bin/bash
